# Concepts

## 1. Component
### 1. Class Component
   ```
      a.constructor
      b.state and props
      c.lifecyle methods(componentDidMount,componentDidUpdate,etc)
      d.render
      e.export class component
   ```
### 2. Functional Component
   ```
      a. props
      b. useState
      c. useEffect
      d. useRef
      e. return
      f. export function component
   ```
## 2. React Hooks 
   ```
      a. useState (react)
      b. useref (react)
      c. useEffect (react)
      d. useLocation (react-router-dom)
      e. useNavigate (react-router-dom)
      f. useParams (react-router-dom)
      g. useSelector (react-redux)
      h. useDispatch (react-redux)
   ```

## 3. Redux
```
   a. actions :- ( Actions have a type field that tells what kind of action to perform and all other fields contain 
                  information or data. in "src/app/redux/actions" folder contains files with redux actions)
                  
   b. reducer :- (a reducer is a pure function that takes an action and the previous state of the application and
                  returns the new state. in "src/app/redux/reducers" contains file with reducer functions)
                  
   c. store :-    ("src/app/redux/store" contains a file in which store is created.)
   
   d. createStore :-  (a method used to create a storage space where data would be stored and provided to application)
   
   e. combineReducers :- (method used to combine multiple reducers)
   
   f. Provider  :-  (a component which works as a wrapper for other components where redux storage needs 
                     to be accessed by any component not encapsulated inside this wrapper would not be able 
                     to access redux storage.)
                     
   g. useSelector,useDispatch :-  (hookes used in function components to access and manipulate redux storage)
   
   h. connect :-  (a method used with "mapStateToProps" method to use redux in class components)   
```
## 4. Redux Toolkit
## 5. React-Router-Dom
```
   a.BrowserRouter      (a component which works as a wrapper for other components which use routing in react)
   
   b.Routes       (a Routes component is similar to a "switch" statement in many programming languages ,    
                  it switches between components according to route path, hence it encapsulates all components 
                  which need to be switched between each other.)
                  
   c.Route         (it defines a particular path for a component to be displayed in react-dom)
   
   e.useLocation   (hook used to access location and data passed through previous component)
   
   f.useNavigate   (hook used to navigate )
   
   g.Navigate (a component used to navigate through react-dom)
   
   h.Link (a component used to navigate through react-dom)
```
## 6. React-Bootstrap
```
   a.React-Bootstrap Components     
   b.inline styling   
   c.bootstrap classes
```
## 7. Bootstrap 
```
   a.bootstrap components   
   b.bootstrap classes
```

## 8. Regular Expression
   ```
   a.create a regular expression   
   b.test data against regular
   ```

## 9. Axios
```
   a.GET,POST,PUT,DELETE requests  
   b.headers      
   c.params   
   d.query   
   e.request body
```
## 10.Sass
```
   a. preprocessing
   b. using variables
   c. nesting
   d. partials
   e. modules
   f. extend/inheritance
   g. operators
   h. mixins
```
## 11. Reuseable Components :- 
   (These components are like a template which can be used multiple times in our project and used with props to pass data into it.)

## 12. Environmental files :- 
   (these files are used to store sensitive data like certain tokens and PORT numbers, connection links ,etc.)
